Constraints
============

Your code will be compiled using standard Java 7. It must implement the answer() method in the solution stub.

Execution time is limited. Some classes are restricted (e.g. java.lang.ClassLoader).
You will see a notice if you use a restricted class when you verify your solution.

Third-party libraries,input/output operations, spawning threads or processes
and changes to the execution environment are not allowed.
